Observable trends in the data:

Please note that while I could not get all the sections to run I used the results listed in the expected results to draw my conclusions.

The top 5 performing schools, at least by overall passing math and reading scores, are Charter schools.  Those schools had an overall passing percentage of over 90%.

The 5 bottom performing schools are District schools at least by overall passing math and reading scores. Those schools had an overall passing percentage of roughly 53%.

At the summary level the Charter schools had an enormous overall passing percentage over District schools â€“ specifically a 90.43% compared to 53.67%.  That is very much in line with the top 5 and bottom 5 schools overall passing percentage rates listed in the first 2 bullets above.

The scores by school spending table surprisingly indicates that the lower spending per student schools yields much higher overall passing percentages. For example, the lowest spending range per student school (under $585) has an overall passing percentage of 90.37% compared to the highest spending range per student school ($645-680) which had only a 53.52% overall passing percentage.

The smaller school sized units under a 1,000 had an overall passing percentage of 89.88% compared to the largest schools (2,000-5,000) which had just a 58.28% overall passing rate.  Perhaps this is an indicator that teachers with a fewer number of students allows more individual attention to help students learn and answer questions.
